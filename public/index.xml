      <description>It’s been about 4 years since the last blog article was written. Over the time, I have collected a series of different thoughts around Engineering and Management, and I am finally taking the time to pen them down into words.
Here’s to the new blog!</description>

      <description>Hello. I am Victor, and I am based in sunny Singapore.
I head up the Engineering team at Carousell, and spend a bit of my time reading through studies and books on management, and primarily use this blog to share my thoughts on them.
If you are looking for book recommendations on Management or Engineering Management, you can check out my GoodReads list to see what are the top books that I have read and would highly recommend.</description>
